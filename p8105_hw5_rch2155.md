## Problem 1

``` r
homicide_df =
  read_csv("./hom-data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),

```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

  mutate(path = str_c("lda-data/", path),
         data = map(path, read_csv)) %>%

    week = as.numeric(week)) %>% 
  select(-data1, -data2, -file, -arm) %>% 
  relocate(study_arm)
